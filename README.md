# KIM-1 Programmable Memory Board for the MTU Backplane

## **WARNING**

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND CURRENTLY THE DESIGN IS UNTESTED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!**

## About

This is a fully programmable RAM/ROM expansion board for MTU backplanes, like the one in the original K-1005 card file, my [expansion card](https://github.com/eduardocasino/kim-1-mtu-expansion-card) or my buffered motherboard.

It uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W to emulate the 64K RAM/ROM memory map, and can read and/or update any part of the memory from a PC over WiFi.
